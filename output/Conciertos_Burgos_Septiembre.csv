I feel you're on the run
Never lived too long to make right
I see you're doing fine
And when I get that feeling

I can no longer slide

I can no longer run

Ah no no

And when I get that feeling

I can no longer hide

For it's no longer fun

Ah no no



Well, you can say what you want

But it won't change my mind

I'll feel the same

About you

And you can tell me your reasons

But it won't change my feelings

I'll feel the same

About you



What I am is what you want of me

Yeh, now that I'm not there

I took the tables away from you

It's turned that I don't care



And when I get that feeling

I can no longer slide

I can no longer run

Ah no no

And when I get that feeling

I can no longer hide

For it's no longer fun

Ah no no



Well, you can say what you want

But it won't change my mind

I'll feel the same

About you

And you can tell me your reasons

But it won't change my feelings

I'll feel the same

About you



Well, you can say what you want

But that won't change my mind

I'll feel the same

About you

And you can tell me your reasons

But that won't change my feelings

I'll feel the same

About you



I've said goodnight

Try to sleep tight

Ah just dream of me

Go close your eyes

Cause I've closed mine

The sun will shine from time to time

Oh, when you dream of me, yeh



Well, you can say what you want

But it won't change my mind

I'll feel the same

About you

And you can tell me your reasons

But it won't change my feelings

I'll feel the same

Yeh, yeh

Oh yeh



You gave me something

Like loving

And took me in so soon

You took my feelings

>From nothing

Came back at noon

Just maybe

I'm ready

To show myself to you



So if I lose my patience

You must try to understand

(try to understand)

If I lose my patience

Oh yeh



Cause you make me feel

(Yeh, yeh (rep.))

Cause you make me feel wild

You touch my inner smile

You got me in the mood

So come on and make your rule

And free me



You make my wishes

As much as

Your kisses make me blue

You've found my river

Now will you

Escape away too

But mayby

I'm ready

I'm falling into you



So if I lose my patience

You must try to understand

(try to understand)

If I lose my patience

Oh yeh



Cause you make me feel

Cause you make me feel wild

You touch my inner smile

You got me in the mood

So come on and make your rule

And free me

Wow wow wow

Wow yeh



Cause you make me feel

So come on and make your rule

And touch my inner smile



And get my fingers smile, smile, smile, yeh, yeh,



Sometimes I need to be alone

There's times I need for you to phone

Sometimes you make me feel so high

There's times I ask myself why

I just need a friend
I don't want a lover
I just need a friend
You can't just leave me

To face life on my own

I know you don't love me no more

I knew this day it would come

Even when it cuts so deep

It's true I still want you

But the harder I try

The more I seem to lose



[Refrain] :

I don't want a lover

I just need a friend

I've had time to recover

Now that I know it wasn't love



It's always a different story

When it's me who's in the wrong

But you can't have it all

Cause I'm the one who's strong

I've already been burnt before

Once but never again

I know the time will come

That's when you need me then



[Refrain] x2



[Répétition] :

You don't even care

About what I'm saying

You don't even think

What you're doing

All you see is what you want it to be

But in there there's just no room for me



[Refrain]



[Répétition]



[Refrain]



I don't want a lover

I just need a prayer



I know you never cared

Now that I know it wasn't love.",https://api.lyrics.ovh/v1/Texas/I%20Don't%20Want%20A%20Lover

Tired of telling it your way
Yeh I know what I saw
I know that I found the floor

Before you take my heart, reconsider

I've opened the door

I've opened the door



Here comes the summer's son

He burns my skin

I ache again

I'm over you



I thought I had a dream to hold

Maybe that has gone

Your hands reach out and touch me still

But this feels so wrong

Tie me up with your deceit

I could never be malicious

Though I seem so bittersweet
